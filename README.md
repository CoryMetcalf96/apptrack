## Description
AppTrack was the answer to simplifying my job search. With access to hundreds of job boards across the internet, keeping your applications in one place can help to relieve a major amount of stress. This application allows you to get as descriptive as you'd like through your application process, filter by application status, prioritize certain applications, and much more.
